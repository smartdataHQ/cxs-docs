# Best Practices for Extended Semantic Events
Adhering to these best practices ensures your semantic event data is reliable, actionable, and seamlessly integrates into the Context Suite ecosystem. 

Proper implementation of event structures, naming conventions, and enriched properties—guided by our Event Bible and schema documentation—enables immediate utilization of ready-made dashboards, insightful analytics, and operational decision support tools. Following these guidelines helps maintain data quality, privacy compliance, and ensures consistency across your analytics platform.

## Why Use Extended Semantic Events?
Extended Semantic Events provide:

- **Contextual Clarity:**\
  They capture the complete business context around each user or system action, such as detailed product attributes, customer intentions, sentiment, and entity relationships.

- **Operational Observability:**\
   They offer real-time visibility into operations, customer behavior, and market interactions, enabling proactive responses to emerging trends or issues.

- **Automated Enrichment:**\
  Built-in enrichment processes enhance data by automatically classifying, analyzing sentiment, linking entities, and resolving industry-standard identifiers (e.g., GS1 product codes).

- **Unified Analytics:**\
  A consistent schema across events ensures interoperability among various operational systems, analytics dashboards, and reporting tools, simplifying integration efforts.

## Best Practices for Extended Semantic Events
To fully leverage the advantages of Extended Semantic Events, follow these best practices:

### 1. Use the Event Bible for Consistency
- **Consistent Naming:**\
  Follow naming conventions provided in the Event Bible. This ensures your events are immediately recognized and properly classified by predefined dashboards and analytical tools.

- **Defined Structures:**\
  Use the pre-defined event templates from the Event Bible, ensuring all required fields are consistently populated.

### 2. Leverage Extended Properties
- **Complete Information:**\
  Populate extended properties such as classification, sentiment, products, and entity_linking to gain immediate insights from automated analytics tools.

- **Avoid Redundant Data:**\
  Trust automatic server-side enrichments. Populate only the fields necessary for your use case; redundant information or fields automatically populated by the Context Suite should be omitted.

### 3. Ensure Data Quality and Privacy
- **Meaningful Data Only:**\
  Record only relevant properties—do not send unnecessary or sensitive data unless required for analysis.

- **GDPR Compliance:**\
  Use provided structures for sensitive user information (e.g., traits) separately, ensuring compliance with privacy standards and easy removal if needed.

### 4. Prioritize Server-side Tracking for Sensitive or Critical Events
- **Secure Critical Events:**\
  Send sensitive or mission-critical events (transactions, revenue events, account updates) from the server side rather than the client. This ensures data integrity, avoids client-side interference (e.g., ad-blockers or script blockers), and guarantees reliable delivery.

- **Reliability and Accuracy:**\
  Server-side tracking provides a secure, trusted environment for critical data, reducing the risk of manipulation and improving overall data accuracy.

- **Cross-Platform Identity Management:**\
  Use consistent user and session identifiers across both client and server events to ensure that identity stitching and profile linking remain accurate and complete.

## Unlock Ready-Made Dashboards, Analysis, and Insights
By carefully adhering to the best practices above and consistently using the Event Bible and extended properties, your events immediately integrate with the Context Suite’s built-in analytics, dashboards, and insights.

Ready-made dashboards will automatically populate, providing you with immediate visibility into critical business metrics, customer behavior trends, sentiment analysis, and detailed operational insights—without additional configuration.

Leveraging Extended Semantic Events correctly not only simplifies your data management but also dramatically reduces the time-to-insight, enabling your organization to rapidly identify opportunities and respond effectively to operational challenges.
