# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}
Semantic events go beyond traditional event tracking by adding rich context and clear meaning to your operational data. While standard analytics events capture basic interactions, extended semantic events enhance those interactions with structured context, deeper insights, and enriched metadata. This richer event model unlocks advanced analytics, enabling organizations to proactively understand customer behavior, streamline operations, and make real-time, data-driven decisions.

Extended Semantic Events build upon the Segment.com event schema by adding specialized properties and structures that provide a comprehensive view of each interaction. These additions include detailed product information, entity linking, classification, sentiment analysis, supply-chain context, and more. By leveraging these extended properties, events become immediately actionable, significantly improving operational observability and decision support.
